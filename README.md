#  Notificoaster-NodeJS

A wifi enabled Arduino with a temperature sensor will measure the temperature of your beverage to be visualized by a mobile iOS app.

## Walkthrough

Notificoaster-NodeJS is currently deployed to Heroku and is used as the backend for the application.

The project will not compile locally if you try and clone it due to the MongoDB key being stored in the Heroku config file.

## Future Items

* Enable push notifications when target temperature threshold is crossed
